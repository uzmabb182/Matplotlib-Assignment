# Matplotlib Assignment - The Power of Plots:

A pharmaceutical company has performed a study research to compare the performance of a drug of interest, Capomulin, verses the other treatment regimens. As a data analyst, my job is to analyze the data and provide with the statistical summary for the results. Below is the analysis.

## Summary of the Statistical Measures:
---
- The drug regimen Capomulin has the lowest mean, median, variance, standard deviation and standard error of mean values as campare to the other regimens.

- Initially, a bar plot is generated for the total number of mice per regimen treatment and found that Capomulin and Ramicane regimen has the highest mice count of 230 and 228 compared to the rest of the other regimens in the study.

- A pie polt is generated that shows that the ditribution of female mice is 49% and male mice is 51% in this study.

- The final tumor volume of each mouse across four regimens:Capomulin, Ramcane, Infubinol and Ceftamin is calculated. Then, from these datasets, quratiles and inter quartile range (IQR) are  calculted. The calculations and box and wiskers plot result shows that there are no potential outliers for Capomulin, Ramcane, and Ceftamin regimen. However, a potential outlier for a mouse id of 'c326', is detected for Infubinol regimen. It is presented with a red marker in the plot.

- A line plot of tumor volume verses the time point for a single mouse id of 'l509' treated with Capomulin is also presented. It shows a relationship of lower tumor volume with higher the timepoint value.

- A scatter plot of average tumor volume verses mouse weight for all mice in the Capomulin regimen is generated. It shows positive relationship between the two variables.

- Finally, the correlation coefficient for average tumor volume verses mouse weight for all mice in the Capomulin regimen  is calculated. It is the statistical measure of strength between the two variables. The value range between -1.0 and +1.0. The value of +0.84 shows a high positive correlation between the average tumor volume verses mouse weight for all mice in the Capomulin regimen.

- Also the 'r' square value range from 0 to 1. Higher the number means better the model is. The value for average tumor volume verses mouse weight for all mice in the Capomulin regimen of +0.70, shows that the 70 percent of variability in the dataset is covered by stright line in this model. The line is able to fit the datapoints very well.
